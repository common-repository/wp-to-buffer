=== Smart Social Media Automation ===

WordPress to Buffer isn't another WP to Facebook, WP to Twitter / X or yet another auto posting plugin.

Our plugin adds your content to your Buffer queue, which is a smart social media scheduling system designed to drip feed your content to your Facebook, Threads, Twitter / X, LinkedIn, Google Business, Mastodon and Bluesky social media profiles.

You can use Buffer's default schedule, or set your own social media scheduling with days and times that work best for your audience.

With Dynamic Tags, you can build truly unique status updates, pulling in your WordPress Post's Title, Content, Excerpt and more.

Buffer's technology ensures you don't accidentally send the same status twice, and with built in protection to prevent your social media profiles being suspended, you'll safely grow, sustain and engage web site traffic and social media following.

=== Simple Social Media Scheduling ===

There's no need to mess around with App IDs, authorization tokens or complicated technical steps.

Connecting your social media profiles is done in a few clicks through Buffer, taking minutes.

Then just choose which of those profiles to use in the plugin, set your status message and your social media scheduling is set.

=== Supports Twitter / X ===

If you're a Jetpack Social, Blog2Social or NextScripts Social Networks Auto-Poster user looking for a replacement to auto publish to Twitter / X, WordPress to Buffer is one of the best auto post to Twitter / X solutions that still works in 2023, as Buffer is [not impacted](https://x.com/buffer/status/1652659063073783808) by Twitter's recent API changes.

=== Data ===

Our [API](https://www.wpzinc.com/documentation/wordpress-buffer-pro/data/) connects your website to [Buffer](https://buffer.com/join/6392aeec568614de895ed38fafa7784b8718c77dc7800419bdfbbacaaaa793d8). An account with Buffer is required.

We connect directly to your Buffer (buffer.com) account, via their API, to:
- Fetch your social media profile names and IDs, 
- Send your WordPress Posts to one or more of your social media profiles.  The profiles and content sent will depend on the plugin settings you have configured.

We connect to our own [API](https://www.wpzinc.com/documentation/wordpress-buffer-pro/data/) to pass the following requests through to Buffer:
- Connect our Plugin to Buffer, when you click the Authorize button (this obtains an access token from Buffer, once you have approved authorization)

Both of these are done via our own API, to ensure that no secret data (such as oAuth client secret keys) are included in this Plugin's code or made public.

We **never** store any information on our web site or API during this process.
